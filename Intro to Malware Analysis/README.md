# Intro to Malware Analysis

### Malware Analysis
- Which team uses malware analysis to look for IOCs and hunt for malware in a network? `Threat hunt team`

### Techniques of malware analysis
- Which technique is used for analyzing malware without executing it? `Static analysis`
- Which technique is used for analyzing malware by executing it and observing its behavior in a controlled environment? `Dynamic analysis`

### Basic Static Analysis
- In the attached VM, there is a sample named 'redline' in the Desktop/Samples directory. What is the md5sum of this sample?<br />

`ca2dc5a3f94c4f19334cc8b68f256259`
- What is the creation time of this sample? <br />

### The PE file Header
- In the attached VM, there is a sample named 'redline' in the directory Desktop/Samples. What is the entropy of the .text section of this sample?<br />

`6.453919`
- The sample named 'redline' has five sections. .text, .rdata, .data and .rsrc are four of them. What is the name of the fifth section?<br />
The answer is in the image above: `.ndata`
- From which dll file does the sample named 'redline' import the RegOpenKeyExW function?<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47d7aad7-762e-43c3-8a31-fc9d35d94b00)<br />
`ADVAPI32.dll`

### Basic Dynamic Analysis
- Check the hash of the sample 'redline' on Hybrid analysis and check out the hybrid analysis report. In the process tree, which is the first process launched when the sample is launched?<br />
Check the previously computed MD5 hash on [HybridAnalysis](https://hybrid-analysis.com/sample/e8ba49a75de083cb786e8ed84972affa11542dd913f1a07b0d44e1d45e5e22e9/64fca500fc4906843d04068e) and scroll down to process tree: <br />

`setup_installer.exe`
- In the process tree, there are two Windows utilities utilized by the malware to perform its activities. What are the names of the two utilities? (Format: utility1.exe and utility2.exe) `cmd.exe and powershell.exe`

### Anti-analysis techniques
- Which of the techniques discussed above is used to bypass static analysis? `packing`
- Which technique discussed above is used to time out a sandbox? `long sleep calls`
