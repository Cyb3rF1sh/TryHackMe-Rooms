# Exploit Vulnerabilities

### Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research
- You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated scanner? (Yay/Nay) `Yay`
- You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this? `Injection`
- You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this? `Broken Access Control`

### Finding Manual Exploits
- What website would you use as a security researcher if you wanted to upload a Proof of Concept? `Github`
- You are performing a penetration test at a site with no internet connection. What tool could you use to find exploits to use? `Searchsploit`

### Example of Manual Exploitation
- What type of vulnerability was used in this attack? `Remote Code Execution`

### Practical: Manual Exploitation
- Find out the version of the application that is running. What are the name and version number of the application? <br />

`Online Book Store v1.0`

- Use this exploit against the vulnerable machine. What is the value of the flag located in a web directory?<br />
From some online search I found the `exploit.py` exploit. <br />
Now run `python3 exploit.py http://target_IP`: <br />
