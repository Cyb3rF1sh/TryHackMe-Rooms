# Linux Fundamentals Part 1

### A Bit of Background on Linux
- Research: What year was the first release of a Linux operating system? `1991` <br /><br />

### Interacting With Your First Linux Machine (In-Browser)
- I've deployed my first Linux machine! `No answer needed` <br /><br />

### Running Your First few Commands
- If we wanted to output the text "TryHackMe", what would our command be? `echo TryHackMe` <br /><br />
- What is the username of who you're logged in as on your deployed Linux machine? `tryhackme` <br /><br />

### Interacting With the Filesystem!
- On the Linux machine that you deploy, how many folders are there? `4` <br /><br />
- Which directory contains a file?  `folder4` <br /><br />
- What is the contents of this file? `Hello World` <br /><br />
- Use the cd command to navigate to this file and find out the new current working directory. What is the path? `/home/tryhackme/folder4` <br /><br />

### Searching for Files
- Use grep on "access.log" to find the flag that has a prefix of "THM". What is the flag? `THM{ACCESS}` <br /><br />
- And I still haven't found what I'm looking for! `No answer needed` <br /><br />

### An Introduction to Shell Operators
- If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use? `&` <br /><br />
- If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be? `echo password123 > passwords` <br /><br />
- Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be `echo tryhackme >> passwords` <br /><br />
- Now use the deployed Linux machine to put these into practice `No answer needed` <br /><br />
