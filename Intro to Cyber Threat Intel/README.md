# Intro to Cyber Threat Intel

### Cyber Threat Intelligence
- What does CTI stand for? `Cyber Threat Intelligence`<br />
- IP addresses, Hashes and other threat artefacts would be found under which Threat Intelligence classification? `Technical Intel`<br />

### CTI Lifecycle
- At which phase of the CTI lifecycle is data converted into usable formats through sorting, organising, correlation and presentation? `Processing`<br />
- During which phase do security analysts get the chance to define the questions to investigate incidents? `Direction`<br />


### CTI Standards & Frameworks
- What sharing models are supported by TAXII? `Collection and Channel`<br />
- When an adversary has obtained access to a network and is extracting data, what phase of the kill chain are they on? `Actions on Objectives`<br />


### Practical Analysis
- What was the source email address? `vipivillain@badbank.com`<br />
- What was the name of the file downloaded? `flbpfuh.exe`<br />
- What was the source email address? <br />
  For this task we need to build the threat profile, by mapping the following data:

      Threat Actor Extraction IP Address: 91.185.23.222
      Threat Actor Email Address: vipivillain@badbank.com
      Malware Tool: flbpfuh.exe
      User Victim Logged Account: Administrator
      Victim Email Recipient: John Doe
      
This will get us the flag: `vipivillain@badbank.com`<br />
