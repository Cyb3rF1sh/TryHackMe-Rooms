# Traffic Analysis Essentials

### Network Security and Network Data
- Which Security Control Level covers contain creating security policies? `Administrative` <br />
- Which Access Control element works with data metrics to manage data flow? `Load Balancing` <br />
- Which technology helps correlate different tool outputs and data sources? `SOAR` <br />

### Traffic Analysis
- Level-1 is simulating the identification and filtering of malicious IP addresses. <br />
As seen from the simulation, the IP addresses sending malicious packets are .99 and .62. <br />
Block these IP addresses to get the flag: `THM{PACKET_MASTER}` <br /><br />
- Level-2 is simulating the identification and filtering of malicious IP and Port addresses. Similar process as before: `THM{DETECTION_MASTER}` <br />
