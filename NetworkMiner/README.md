# NetworkMiner

### Tool Overview 1
- Use mx-3.pcap What is the total number of frames? <br />
Open `NetworkMiner.exe` and then open `mx-3.pcap.` Move to the "frame" section and scroll down to get the total number of captured frames. <br />

The total number of frames is `460`.
- How many IP addresses use the same MAC address with host 145.253.2.203? <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8736e759-4080-44ac-aa45-278323104228)<br />
Simply analyze all of these hosts and check if they are using the same MAC as the given IP address, which is `MAC: FEFF20000100 (Unknown)`.
The answer is `2`.
- How many packets were sent from host 65.208.228.223? <br />
