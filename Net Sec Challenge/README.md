- There is an open port outside the common 1000 ports; it is above 10,000. What is it?<br />

Alternatively, you could run nmap with the `-sC` flag: <br />

  `vsftpd 3.0.5`

- We learned two usernames using social engineering: eddie and quinn. What is the flag hidden in one of these two account files and accessible via FTP?<br />
Let's try to bruteforce the passwords: run `hydra -l eddie -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.161.99:10021`: <br />

Logging into eddie's account, I didn't find any file, let's try to brute force quinn's account: <br />

The flag is in quinn's account, download it using the `get` command: `THM{321452667098}`
- Browsing to http://10.10.161.99:8080 displays a small challenge that will give you a flag once you solve it. What is the flag?<br />

We need to scan the target without getting noticed.  The solution to this challenge is using the `-sN` flag, which is a NULL scan. The null scan does not set any flag; all six flag bits are set to zero.
A TCP packet with no flags set will not trigger any response when it reaches an open port, as shown in the figure below. Therefore, from Nmapâ€™s perspective, a lack of reply in a null scan indicates that either the port is open or a firewall is blocking the packet.
However, we expect the target server to respond with an RST packet if the port is closed.<br />
Run `sudo nmap -sN target_IP` to get the flag: <br />
